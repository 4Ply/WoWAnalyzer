# WoW Analyzer [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MartijnHols/WoWAnalyzer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MartijnHols/WoWAnalyzer)

Use this tool to analyze your performance based on important metrics for your spec using a Warcraft Logs report.

You will need a Warcraft Logs report with advanced combat logging enabled to start. Private logs can not be used, if your guild has private logs you will have to [upload your own logs](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/help/start/) or change the existing logs to the unlisted privacy option instead.

Run it: [https://wowanalyzer.com](https://wowanalyzer.com)

## Contributing

Want to add support for your spec or a module? See the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

I will likely not have time to work on many more specs by myself, so the only way to get your spec in is to help build it.

## Current specs:

See the site for a list of current specs. The following specs bothered to make a custom readme:
 * [Resto Druid](src/Parser/RestoDruid/README.md) (maintained by @blazyb)
 * [Resto Shaman](src/Parser/RestorationShaman/README.md) (maintained by @versaya)
 * [Mistweaver Monk](src/Parser/MistweaverMonk/README.md) (maintained by @anom0ly)
