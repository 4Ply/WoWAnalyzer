# I wanted to make a proxy to prevent abuse of my API key but with a proxy they could still abuse my API key by abusing my proxy which would be double bad. I realized it's called a "public" key for a reason and if it gets abused I can reset it later. Blizzard API keys are getting shared too without problems. Doing this instead of asking users to enter their own key is just the most user friendly.

# You are not allowed to use this API key for any other applications. If you wish to run your own application, you must enter your own API key. You can do this by creating a new file called `.env.local`. It needs to contain `WCL_API_KEY=INSERT_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`. You can get your own API key from the Warcraft Logs settings: https://www.warcraftlogs.com/accounts/changeuser.
# Reason this is required is that the WCL API has a rate limit. If everyone used the production API key during development, it would quickly be capped and break the production app. Please use your own key.
