    [SPELLS.BESTOW_FAITH_TALENT.id]: <span><SpellLink id={SPELLS.BESTOW_FAITH_TALENT.id} /> is the default choice for most encounters in raids. The 5-second delay requires foresight, but this ability gives great healing for a very low mana cost.</span>,
    [SPELLS.LIGHTS_HAMMER_TALENT.id]: <span>Unfortunately <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=114158" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Light's Hammer</a> isn't as good of a choice as it may seem. Even if you can use it on cooldown and it doesn't overheal <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=223306" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bestow Faith</a> will outperform it in all situations. Primarily due to its low mana cost and beacon transfer(s). For this reason it is not recommended to take Light's Hammer.</span>,
    [SPELLS.CRUSADERS_MIGHT_TALENT.id]: <span>Unfortunately <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=196926" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crusader's Might</a> is usually only viable with a unique playstyle that does not work well with the T19 4 set bonus. For this reason it is not recommended to take Crusader's Might.</span>,
    // lv30
    [SPELLS.CAVALIER_TALENT.id]: <span>You can take <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=230332" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cavalier</a> if most of the raid is clumped together and you won't need <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=214202" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rule of Law</a>, or if you have a specific need for two charges of Divine Steed. It's important to understand that two charges doesn't actually mean you get twice as many uses of Divine Steed. If you use both charges at once, only one will recharge at a time meaning it will take 90 seconds for you to have both charges up again.</span>,
    [SPELLS.UNBREAKABLE_SPIRIT_TALENT.id]: <span><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=114154" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unbreakable Spirit</a> is almost never a valid choice.</span>,
    [SPELLS.RULE_OF_LAW_TALENT.id]: <span>Rule of Law is the default choice for raiding. Because the cooldown is so short, you should try to use it with <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=85222" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Light of Dawn</a> as often as you can. Rule of Law is also extremely helpful for healing targets if they happen to be out of range and need healing e.g.: running out with a debuff.</span>,
    // lv45
    [SPELLS.FIST_OF_JUSTICE_TALENT_HOLY.id]: <span>The talent selected in this tier usually has no impact in raids.</span>,
    [SPELLS.REPENTANCE_TALENT.id]: <span>The talent selected in this tier usually has no impact in raids.</span>,
    [SPELLS.BLINDING_LIGHT_TALENT.id]: <span>The talent selected in this tier usually has no impact in raids.</span>,
    // lv60
    [SPELLS.DEVOTION_AURA_TALENT.id]: <span><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=183425" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Devotion Aura</a> and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=183415" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aura of Mercy</a> are both situationally good. Devotion Aura is the best choice to mitigate damage from any heavy-hitting boss mechanic. If you won't need the damage reduction from Devotion Aura, then you should take Aura of Mercy as it will result in more overall healing.</span>,
    [SPELLS.AURA_OF_SACRIFICE_TALENT.id]: <span><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=183416" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aura of Sacrifice</a> works as a decent raid cooldown with <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=31821" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aura Mastery</a>. It is best to use it during <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=31842" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Avenging Wrath</a> and/or <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=105809" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Holy Avenger</a>. For this reason it is more situationally useful as not all encounters work out such that you can line up all your cool downs at once, and have it not be wasted. *note* healing done by <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=85222" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Light of Dawn</a> does not transfer through Aura of Sacrifice's empowered effect.</span>,
    [SPELLS.AURA_OF_MERCY_TALENT.id]: <span><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=183425" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Devotion Aura</a> and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=183415" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aura of Mercy</a> are both situationally good. Devotion Aura is the best choice to mitigate damage from any heavy-hitting boss mechanic. If you won't need the damage reduction from Devotion Aura, then you should take Aura of Mercy as it will result in more overall healing.</span>,
    // lv75
    [SPELLS.DIVINE_PURPOSE_TALENT_HOLY.id]: <span><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=197646" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Divine Purpose</a> provides a small chance for a free Holy Shock or Light of Dawn, which saves mana by not having to cast something that consumes mana. The downside to Divine Purpose is that it is not very reliable, unlike <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=105809" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Holy Avenger</a>. This tier is mostly preference.</span>,
    [SPELLS.HOLY_AVENGER_TALENT.id]: <span><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=105809" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Holy Avenger</a> provides a lot of on-demand healing. The downside to Holy Avenger is that is requires fairly heavy mana usage to be effective. This tier is mostly preference.</span>,
    [SPELLS.HOLY_PRISM_TALENT.id]: <span><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=114165" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Holy Prism</a> provides you another AoE heal similar to <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=85222" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Light of Dawn</a>. It doesn't heal for a lot while it's mana cost is fairly high, so it is usually not recommended to pick this talent. This tier is mostly preference.</span>,
    // lv90
    [SPELLS.FERVENT_MARTYR_TALENT.id]: <span>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWaLxFIVX1s</span>,
    [SPELLS.SACTIFIED_WRATH_TALENT.id]: <span>Only take <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=53376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sanctified Wrath</a> if a fight really requires burst healing, otherwise <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=183778" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Judgment of Light</a> is always the better choice (especially with <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=137086" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="legendary">Chain of Thrayn</a>).</span>,
    [SPELLS.JUDGMENT_OF_LIGHT_TALENT.id]: <span><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=183778" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Judgment of Light</a> is the default choice in this tier as it does a lot of consistent healing.</span>,
    // lv100
    [SPELLS.BEACON_OF_FAITH_TALENT.id]: <span><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=156910" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beacon of Faith</a> is excellent when both tanks are taking damage; specifically if there are a lot of adds that the off-tank has to pick up, or on any fight where the boss cleaves onto both tanks. In the Nighthold this is the best default choice.</span>,
    [SPELLS.BEACON_OF_THE_LIGHTBRINGER_TALENT.id]: <span><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=197446" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beacon of the Lightbringer</a> only provides a single beacon so requires you to manage swapping your Beacon onto the tank that is taking damage. The upside is that it increases your mastery effectiveness and the healing of <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=85222" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Light of Dawn</a>. In the Nighthold there is rarely a good reason to pick this talent over <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=156910" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beacon of Faith</a>.</span>,
    [SPELLS.BEACON_OF_VIRTUE_TALENT.id]: <span><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=200025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beacon of Virtue</a> is rarely a good choice in raids. It requires you to use a Global Cooldown to apply to random targets and costs a considerable amount of mana.</span>,
