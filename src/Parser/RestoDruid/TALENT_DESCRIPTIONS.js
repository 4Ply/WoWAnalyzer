  descriptions: {
    [SPELLS.PROSPERITY_TALENT.id]: <span>Unfortunately <SpellLink id={SPELLS.PROSPERITY_TALENT.id} /> is right now shit tier, please dont use it for raids. </span>,
    [SPELLS.CENARION_WARD_TALENT.id]: <span><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=102351" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cenarion Ward</a> is the best talent in this tier in almost all situations.</span>,
    [SPELLS.ABUNDANCE_TALENT.id]: <span><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=207383" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Abundance</a> is usually not a recommended talent for raiding, however it's decent for M+ dungeons</span>,
    [SPELLS.RENEWAL_TALENT.id]: <span><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=108238" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Renewal</a> is a big self-heal on a long-ish cooldown which is off the global cooldown. This talent is usualy not chosen because the lack of movement utility <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=108238" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Displacer Beast</a> offer is better.</span>,
    [SPELLS.DISPLACER_BEAST_TALENT.id]: <span><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=108238" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Displacer Beast</a> is the default choice for this tier. Basically a Blink with kitty Spring tagged onto the end.</span>,
    [SPELLS.WILD_CHARGE_TALENT.id]: <span><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=102401" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wild Charge</a> is usually worse than Displacer Bear when it comes to movement utility. Why are you using Wild Charge?????</span>,
    [SPELLS.BALANCE_AFFINITY_TALENT.id]: <span><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=197632" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Balance Affinity</a> is useful whenever you need the extra passive 5 yard range increase. However it offers less DPS than <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=197490" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Feral Affinity</a> .</span>,
    [SPELLS.FERAL_AFFINITY_TALENT.id]: <span><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=197490" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Feral Affinity</a> offers passive 15% movement speed, however it offers the highest DPS by <a href="https://questionablyepic.com/restodruid-catweaving/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">catweaving</a>. This talent is usually only taken if you need the extra dps.</span>,
    [SPELLS.GUARDIAN_AFFINITY_TALENT.id]: <span><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=197491" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guardian Affinity</a> offers a flat 6% damage taken reduction. It also gives you <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=22842" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frenzied Regeneration</a> which can be life saving (or good for padding healing). This is usually the default talent, great choice!</span>,
    [SPELLS.MIGHTY_BASH_TALENT.id]: <span>This talent row usually has no impact on performance. This can be useful on encounters with bigger adds that you can stun or procc Sephuz Secret with</span>,
    [SPELLS.MASS_ENTANGLEMENT_TALENT.id]: <span>This talent row usually has no impact on performance. This can be useful if you need a spell to procc Sephuz Secret with</span>,
    [SPELLS.TYPHOON_TALENT.id]: <span>This talent row usually has no impact on performance. This can be useful if you need a spell to push adds e.g. Illgynoth blobs.</span>,
    [SPELLS.SOUL_OF_THE_FOREST_TALENT.id]: <span>You should not at any point use this talent right now. <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=158478" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Soul of the Forest</a> is unfortunately mathematically inferior to both <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=200390" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cultivation</a> and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=33891" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tree of Life</a>.</span>,
    [SPELLS.CULTIVATION_TALENT.id]: <span>This is usualy the default talent. <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=200390" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cultivation</a> provides a free passive HoT on players actually needing heal (sub 60% hp), it also increases the overall average mastery count on players. It is also the easiest talent to play with.</span>,
    [SPELLS.INCARNATION_TREE_OF_LIFE_TALENT.id]: <span><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=33891" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Incarnation: Tree of Life</a> or simply ToL. This talent has actually been proven to be a decent or sometimes a superior choice to <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=200390" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cultivation</a>. This talent requires some planning to be used optimally. You have to take into account the 3 minute cooldown and plan accordingly, e.g. a 2.30 minute fight you would only be able to use this ability once, but on a 3.30 minute fight you would get 2 active uses. ToL is also preferred whenever people rarely drop below 60% hp or/and you need the on demand burst healing. With the nerfs coming to cultivation in 7.2.5 this might actually be the default pick.</span>,
    [SPELLS.SPRING_BLOSSOMS_TALENT.id]: <span>A good talent for some encounters. Spring blossom counts as a mastery stack and can be extended by <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=197721" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flourish</a> and a well placed spring blossoms can give you around 9-12 extra mastery stacks up (depending on your haste). This talent requires some planning to get optimal value as you would need to have a high uptime (>90%) on <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=145205" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Efflorescence</a> and your raid members being grouped up most the time.</span>,
    [SPELLS.INNER_PEACE_TALENT.id]: <span>This talent requires some planning with your healing team to optimize. Useful if you can get a few extra good tranquilities in, useless otherwise.</span>,
    [SPELLS.GERMINATION_TALENT.id]: <span>This talent shines on encounters where you need to have extra focus on specific targets. Also if you have the T19 4P and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=137072/amanthuls-wisdom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amanthuls Wisdom</a> this will most likely be your default talent choice.</span>,
    [SPELLS.MOMENT_OF_CLARITY_TALENT.id]: <span>You are either a Korean meme-lord or you dont know how to play this game, avoid this talent.</span>,
    [SPELLS.STONEBARK_TALENT.id]: <span>This is a weak talent for raiding and you should not be using this, please stop using this.</span>,
    [SPELLS.FLOURISH_TALENT.id]: <span>Default top tier talent, use it and love it. Always aim to extend <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=48438" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wild Growth</a> and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=102351" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cenarion Ward</a>.</span>,
