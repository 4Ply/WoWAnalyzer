Even if you can use it on cooldown and it doesn\'t overheal <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=223306" target="_blank">Bestow Faith</a> will outperform it in all situations. Primarily due to its low mana cost and beacon transfer(s). For this reason it is not recommended to take Light\'s Hammer.',

It\'s important to understand that two charges doesn\'t actually mean you get twice as many uses of Divine Steed. If you use both charges at once, only one will recharge at a time meaning it will take 90 seconds for you to have both charges up again.',

Rule of Law is also extremely helpful for healing targets if they happen to be out of range and need healing e.g.: running out with a debuff.',

For this reason it is more situationally useful as not all encounters work out such that you can line up all your cool downs at once, and have it not be wasted. *note* healing done by <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=85222" target="_blank">Light of Dawn</a> does not transfer through Aura of Sacrifice\'s empowered effect.',
