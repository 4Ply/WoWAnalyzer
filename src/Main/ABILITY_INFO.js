    description: 'Unfortunately <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=114158" target="_blank">Light\'s Hammer</a> isn\'t as good of a choice as it may seem. Even if you can use it on cooldown and it doesn\'t overheal <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=223306" target="_blank">Bestow Faith</a> will outperform it in all situations. Primarily due to its low mana cost and beacon transfer(s). For this reason it is not recommended to take Light\'s Hammer.',

    icon: 'ability_paladin_swiftretribution',
    description: 'Unfortunately <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=196926" target="_blank">Crusader\'s Might</a> is usually only viable with a unique playstyle that does not work well with the T19 4 set bonus. For this reason it is not recommended to take Crusader\'s Might.',

    description: 'You can take <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=230332" target="_blank">Cavalier</a> if most of the raid is clumped together and you won\'t need <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=214202" target="_blank">Rule of Law</a>, or if you have a specific need for two charges of Divine Steed. It\'s important to understand that two charges doesn\'t actually mean you get twice as many uses of Divine Steed. Realistically, you\'ll only get one extra charge if you\'re using Divine Steed frequently.',

    name: 'Rule of Law',
    icon: 'ability_paladin_longarmofthelaw',
    description: 'Rule of Law is the default choice for raiding. Because the cooldown is so short, you should try to use it with <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=85222" target="_blank">Light of Dawn</a> as often as you can. Rule of Law is also extremely helpful for healing targets if they happen to be out of range and need healing e.g.: running out with a debuff.',

Devotion Aura is the best choice to mitigate damage from any heavy-hitting boss mechanic. If you won\'t need the damage reduction from Devotion Aura, then you should take Aura of Mercy as it will result in more overall healing.',

    icon: 'ability_deathwing_bloodcorruption_earth',
    description: '<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=183416" target="_blank">Aura of Sacrifice</a> works as a decent raid cooldown with <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=31821" target="_blank">Aura Mastery</a> it is best to use it during <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=31842" target="_blank">Avenging Wrath</a> and/or <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=105809" target="_blank">Holy Avenger</a>. For this reason it is more situationally useful as not all encounters work out such that you can line up all your cool downs at once, and have it not be wasted. *note* healing done by <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=85222" target="_blank">Light of Dawn</a> does not transfer through Aura of Sacrifice\'s empowered effect.',

    description: '<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=197646" target="_blank">Divine Purpose</a> provides a small chance for a free Holy Shock or Light of Dawn, which reduces your mana usage. The downside to Divine Purpose is that it is not very reliable, unlike <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=105809" target="_blank">Holy Avenger</a>. This tier is mostly preference.',

It doesn\'t heal for a lot while it\'s mana cost is fairly high, so it is usually not recommended to pick this talent. This tier is mostly preference.',

    description: '<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=197446" target="_blank">Beacon of the Lightbringer</a> only provides a single beacon so requires you to manage swapping your Beacon onto the tank that is taking damage. The upside is that it increases your mastery effectiveness and the healing of <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=85222" target="_blank">Light of Dawn</a>.
