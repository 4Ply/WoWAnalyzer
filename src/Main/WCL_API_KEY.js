// I wanted to make a proxy to prevent abuse of my API key but with a proxy they could still abuse my API key by abusing my proxy which would be double bad.

Doing this is just the most user friendly.

// You are not allowed to use this API key for any other applications. If you wish to run your own application, you must enter your own
